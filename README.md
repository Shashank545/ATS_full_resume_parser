To meet the business and technical requirements outlined above, we'll develop two versions of the resume parser:

1. **Version 1: English Resume Parser**
2. **Version 2: Multilingual Resume Parser**

Let's start with Version 1:

### Version 1: English Resume Parser

For this version, we'll focus on parsing PDF and Word resumes written in English with high accuracy and speed.

#### Steps to Implement Version 1:

1. **Setup Development Environment:** Set up the development environment with necessary tools and libraries.
2. **Parse PDF and Word Resumes:** Implement logic to parse PDF and Word resumes using libraries such as PyPDF2 and python-docx.
3. **Extract Information:** Extract relevant information from the resumes, such as personal details, contact information, education, experience, skills, etc.
4. **Organize Data:** Organize the extracted information into the specified output format.
5. **Handle Errors and Edge Cases:** Implement error handling and address any edge cases to ensure robustness.
6. **Optimize for Speed:** Optimize the parser for speed to meet the p95 response time requirement.
7. **Testing:** Test the parser with a variety of English resumes to ensure accuracy and reliability.
8. **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation on how to use the parser, including setup instructions and usage examples.

### Version 2: Multilingual Resume Parser

For this version, we'll extend the parser to support parsing resumes in multiple languages.

#### Steps to Implement Version 2:

1. **Language Detection:** Implement language detection logic to identify the language of the resume.
2. **Language-specific Parsing:** Extend the parser to handle parsing logic specific to each supported language.
3. **Translation (Optional):** If necessary, implement translation functionality to translate non-English resumes into English for parsing.
4. **Multilingual Output:** Modify the output format to support multilingual resumes and ensure consistency across different languages.
5. **Testing:** Test the multilingual parser with resumes in various languages to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6. **Documentation:** Update the documentation to include information on supported languages and any additional setup steps for multilingual parsing.

By following these steps, we can develop both Version 1 and Version 2 of the resume parser to meet the specified requirements.
